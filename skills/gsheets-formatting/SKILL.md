# Google Sheets Formatting

A base skill that wraps every Google Sheets write. The job is simple and strict: **observe first, then write**. Before any `googleSheetsCreate` / `googleSheetsWriteRange` / `googleSheetsFormat` / `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` call, sample the user's existing sheets, distill a style profile, and apply it. The longer a user works with the assistant, the more their sheets should look like a coherent set — not a bag of independently-styled outputs.

## Core principle

The user has a taste they may not be able to articulate. They can describe *content* ("track my deals with stage + amount") but rarely *style* ("bold header row, frozen top, 140px wide name column, light-grey banding, date as `YYYY-MM-DD`"). Treat their prior sheets as the spec. If there are no prior sheets, fall back to the defaults in this skill.

**Never** ship a sheet whose styling was picked without evidence when evidence was reachable. One `findGDriveFiles` + one `googleSheetsReadRange` is cheap; a mismatched sheet the user has to re-style by hand is expensive.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Decide what data belongs in a sheet.** That's the user's call — this skill owns the *look*, not the *content*.
- **Create non-sheet artifacts.** Docs go to `googleDocsCreate`, Slides to `googleSlidesCreatePresentation`. A "tracker" in a Doc table is a different skill.
- **Edit a user-owned file the assistant didn't create without picker consent.** The `gdrive` connector uses `drive.file` scope — unpicked files return 404. If the user references a sheet you can't read, ask them to add it via the picker.
- **Parse *cell-level* visual formatting from the typed read path today.** Sheet-level formatting (theme, tab color, freezes, banding, conditional rules, Tables) IS returned by the default `spreadsheets.get` and is the primary "learn" source — see below. Only per-cell `userEnteredFormat` (individual fills, fonts, borders) needs `includeGridData=true` or a `fields` mask, which Use Brian's `googleSheetsGetInfo(id)` wrapper does not expose yet.

## Tool map

| Tool | Role in this skill |
|---|---|
| `findGDriveFiles` | Discover prior assistant-created sheets by `kind: 'sheet'` + optional `query`. Read-only, concurrency-safe. Primary source for convention inheritance. |
| `googleSheetsGetInfo` | Inspect sheet metadata — titles, tab colors, dimensions, frozen rows/columns. |
| `googleSheetsReadRange` | Inspect rendered values. Use for header wording, data shape, enum vocabularies, number/date rendering. |
| `googleSheetsCreate` | Create a new spreadsheet. Auto-authorized — no picker needed. |
| `googleSheetsWriteRange` | Overwrite a range. Values are parsed as if typed (formulas, dates, numbers). |
| `googleSheetsFormat` | Typed polish: `boldHeader`, `freezeRows`, `freezeColumns`, `autoResizeColumns`, `columnWidths`, `wrapText`, `dataValidations`. Covers the 80%. |
| `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` | Raw Sheets API for everything else — banding, borders, conditional formatting, merged cells, charts, pivot tables, protected ranges, **and `copyPaste` (see Style inheritance below)**. Requires a one-line `summary` shown in the approval prompt. Destructive request types need `allowDestructive: true` and always prompt. |

## The pre-flight inspection workflow

Run before **every** sheets write. Keep it short — the goal is a small, reusable style profile, not an audit.

### Step 1 — Decide the reference set

Three cases, in order of priority:

1. **Editing an existing sheet.** The target sheet itself *is* the reference. Read it, use its conventions, do not drift.
2. **Creating a new sheet on a recurring topic** ("another CRM update", "weekly metrics", "deals this month"). Find the user's prior sheet in the same domain via `findGDriveFiles({ kind: 'sheet', query: '<domain keyword>' })` and use it as the canonical template.
3. **Creating a new sheet with no clear topic match.** Sample the 2–3 most recently-created assistant sheets via `findGDriveFiles({ kind: 'sheet' })` to learn the user's generic defaults (how they like headers, freezes, date formats).

If `findGDriveFiles` returns nothing, skip to [Defaults](#defaults-when-no-reference-exists).

### Step 2 — Inspect each reference sheet

For every reference:

- Call `googleSheetsGetInfo(spreadsheetId)` — capture sheet names, `gridProperties.frozenRowCount`, `gridProperties.frozenColumnCount`, `tabColor`, row/column count.
- Call `googleSheetsReadRange(spreadsheetId, 'Sheet1!A1:Z3')` (or whichever tab matters) — enough to see the header row and 1–2 data rows.
- If there are enum-like columns (Status, Type, Priority), widen to `'Sheet1!<col>2:<col>50'` to sample the vocabulary.

That's usually all you need. Do **not** read thousands of rows to learn a pattern — the first 2–3 rows after the header tell you everything.

### Step 3 — Distill a style profile

Fill in this table in working memory. Skip any field you have no evidence for — don't invent.

| Dimension | Source of signal | How to apply |
|---|---|---|
| **Header row** | Row 1 of references. Are headers terse (`Amount`) or prose (`Deal Amount (USD)`)? Capitalized or sentence-case? | Match the user's voice when you write new headers. |
| **Freeze rows** | `gridProperties.frozenRowCount` | Pass same value to `googleSheetsFormat({ freezeRows })`. Default to `1` if unseen. |
| **Freeze columns** | `gridProperties.frozenColumnCount` | Pass to `googleSheetsFormat({ freezeColumns })`. Default to `0`. |
| **Column widths** | Visible content length in reference + eyeball pattern (identifier cols narrow, description cols wide). | Map to `columnWidths: [{ column: 'A', pixelSize: N }]`. |
| **Wrap text** | Long prose in cells of reference? | `wrapText: true` for description-heavy sheets, else skip. |
| **Date format** | Render of date-typed cells in `googleSheetsReadRange`. | When writing, use the same string form (`2026-04-24` vs `24 Apr 2026` vs `4/24/2026`). |
| **Number formats** | Currency symbol, decimal places, thousand separators in reference. | Match in `userEnteredFormat.numberFormat` via `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` (request kind: `repeatCell`). |
| **Enum vocabulary** | Column values in references labeled like Status / Stage / Type / Priority. | Pass to `dataValidations: [{ range, values, strict: true }]`. **Reuse exact spellings** — `"Active"` and `"active"` are not the same enum. |
| **Tab color** | `sheets[].properties.tabColor` | Reapply via `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` (`updateSheetProperties`). |
| **Bold header** | Can't read directly from typed tools. Assume `true` if the user has accepted it in prior assistant-created sheets, else default `true`. | `googleSheetsFormat({ boldHeader: true })`. |
| **Banding** | Not directly readable; treat as a user preference once set. | Reapply via `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` `addBanding` when you know the user wants it. |
| **Sheet naming** | Does the user prefer `Sheet1` (default) or renamed tabs (`Deals`, `Notes`, `Archive`)? | When creating, rename the first tab to match the topic if that matches the pattern. |
| **File naming** | Pattern in `findGDriveFiles` results: `Deals — 2026 Q2`, `Weekly Metrics (W17)`, etc. | Follow the same pattern for the new title. |
| **Theme, banding, conditional rules, Tables** | Sheet-level fields on `spreadsheets.get` — see **Mode 1** below for the full list and how to replay. | Replay via `batchUpdate` rebound to destination ranges — do not use `PASTE_FORMAT`. |
| **Cell fills, fonts, borders** | Needs `includeGridData` / fields mask — see **Mode 3**. | Blocked on tool lift today. |

## Style inheritance — the four modes

Sheets exposes several layers of style abstraction. Pick the mode that matches the target's shape and the reference's structure. **Prefer higher-abstraction modes** — they generalize across shapes; cell-level transfer does not.

### Mode 1 — Semantic extraction (primary path, works today)

The default `spreadsheets.get` response returns sheet-level style abstractions **without** `includeGridData`:

- `properties.spreadsheetTheme` — `primaryFontFamily` + `themeColors[]` (TEXT, BACKGROUND, ACCENT1..6, LINK mapped to concrete colors). Spreadsheet-wide.
- `properties.locale`, `properties.timeZone`, `properties.defaultFormat` — localization + base number/text defaults.
- `sheets[].properties.tabColor`, `.gridProperties.frozenRowCount` / `.frozenColumnCount`.
- `sheets[].bandedRanges[]` — banding schemes (header/footer colors + alternating body colors, with an `A1`-like `range`).
- `sheets[].conditionalFormats[]` — rules with `booleanRule` / `gradientRule` and their target `ranges`.
- `sheets[].tables[]` — any Sheets Tables (see Mode 2).

**Apply to destination:**

1. `batchUpdate` → `updateSpreadsheetProperties` with `{ spreadsheetTheme }` and `fields: "spreadsheetTheme"`. Single call carries font + palette to the new spreadsheet.
2. `googleSheetsFormat({ freezeRows, freezeColumns })` from the reference's `gridProperties`.
3. `batchUpdate` → `updateSheetProperties` with `tabColor` + `fields: "tabColor"` per tab where relevant.
4. `batchUpdate` → `addBanding` / `addConditionalFormatRule`, each **rebound to the destination `range`** (the rules' logic travels; the anchor is rewritten).

This is genuine learn-then-apply — you extracted abstractions, not pixels, and replayed them over a differently-shaped destination without breakage.

### Mode 2 — Table-first creation (the power move for new sheets)

When creating a new sheet, wrap the data region in a **Sheets Table**. Tables are semantic: they auto-apply formatted header + banding, carry typed column formats + validations, and **auto-extend formatting on append** (via `AppendCellsRequest` with `tableId`).

```json
{
  "addTable": {
    "table": {
      "name": "Deal Pipeline",
      "range": { "sheetId": <id>, "startRowIndex": 0, "endRowIndex": N, "startColumnIndex": 0, "endColumnIndex": M },
      "columnProperties": [
        { "columnIndex": 0, "columnName": "Name",   "columnType": "TEXT" },
        { "columnIndex": 1, "columnName": "Amount", "columnType": "NUMERIC" },
        { "columnIndex": 2, "columnName": "Close",  "columnType": "DATE" },
        { "columnIndex": 3, "columnName": "Stage",  "columnType": "DROPDOWN",
          "dataValidationRule": { "condition": { "type": "ONE_OF_LIST", "values": [...] } } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Column types: `TEXT`, `NUMERIC`, `DATE`, `DROPDOWN` (requires `ONE_OF_LIST`), `PERCENT`, `CHECKBOX`, `RATING`, `SMART_CHIP`. `RATING` and `CHECKBOX` auto-default to 0 and FALSE.

If the user's reference sheet was itself built as a Table, copy its `columnProperties` directly — the schema *is* the profile. Even if references are plain ranges, promoting the destination to a Table is usually an upgrade: future appends self-style.

### Mode 3 — Cell-level extraction (blocked on tool lift)

For fine-grained per-cell fidelity (cell fills, bold headers, borders, custom per-column number formats):

```
GET /v4/spreadsheets/{id}?fields=sheets(properties,data.rowData.values(userEnteredFormat)),sheets.bandedRanges
```

or `?includeGridData=true` for the full grid. `userEnteredFormat` is the `CellFormat` resource: `numberFormat`, `backgroundColorStyle`, `borders`, `padding`, `horizontalAlignment`, `verticalAlignment`, `wrapStrategy`, `textFormat.{bold, italic, strikethrough, underline, fontFamily, fontSize, foregroundColorStyle}`. `effectiveFormat` shows conditional-rule-composed rendering (read-only).

Replay via `repeatCell` (for uniform ranges like a header row) or `updateCells` (per-cell). **Blocked today** by Use Brian's `googleSheetsGetInfo` not accepting `fields`/`includeGridData` — see Gaps to flag upstream.

### Mode 4 — Mechanical transfer (`copyPaste PASTE_FORMAT`) — limited shortcut

`copyPaste` with `pasteType: "PASTE_FORMAT"` copies `userEnteredFormat` + data validation from source cells to destination cells 1:1 by position, with **tiling** when the destination is larger and **truncation** when smaller. It does *not* abstract — a 5-row intro block tiled across 100 rows produces nonsense.

Safe uses:

- **Header row → header row (1:1)**: shapes always match, output is clean.
- **One representative body row tiled across a uniform destination body range**: works when every body row should look the same.

Unsafe uses (use Mode 1 instead):

- Multi-row template headers, whole-sheet templating, banding-sensitive layouts, conditional rules bound to varying ranges, different column counts.

Limited to **same-spreadsheet** source + destination. Cross-file transfer requires `spreadsheets.sheets.copyTo` (not wrapped today). PasteType siblings exist (`PASTE_VALUES`, `PASTE_FORMULA`, `PASTE_DATA_VALIDATION`, `PASTE_CONDITIONAL_FORMATTING`, `PASTE_NO_BORDERS`, `PASTE_NORMAL`) but rarely beat Mode 1 for style work.

### Mode 5 — Value-based inference (last-resort fallback)

When Modes 1–4 are all unavailable (no references, cross-file, no tool lift), infer from rendered values in `googleSheetsReadRange` output: number format from strings like `"$1,234.50"`, date format from `"2026-04-24"` vs `"24 Apr 2026"`, enum vocabulary from distinct values in a column, column width proxy from max content length. Apply via `googleSheetsFormat` + targeted `repeatCell` number formats.

### Step 4 — Apply the profile

Order: **spreadsheet-wide style → tab structure → semantic shape (Table) → values → remaining polish.**

1. `googleSheetsCreate({ title })` — new sheet.
2. `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` with `updateSpreadsheetProperties` (set `spreadsheetTheme` from the reference — Mode 1). One-line `summary`: `"Apply theme from <reference name>"`.
3. `googleSheetsFormat({ freezeRows, freezeColumns, autoResizeColumns, columnWidths })` — structural defaults inherited from the reference's `gridProperties` or the baseline defaults.
4. `googleSheetsWriteRange` — headers + any seed data.
5. `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` with `addTable` — promote the header + body range to a Sheets Table (Mode 2). Carries banding + validation + auto-extend for free.
6. `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` — remaining polish: `addBanding` / `addConditionalFormatRule` rebound from the reference, `updateSheetProperties` for `tabColor`, per-column number formats via `repeatCell`. Skip any dimension the Table already handles.

Prefer `googleSheetsFormat` over raw `batchUpdate` whenever a typed option exists (auto-authorized for assistant-owned files; raw `batchUpdate` prompts on destructive kinds).

### Step 5 — Brief the user

After the last write, tell the user:

- What you created / edited and the URL.
- Which conventions you inherited ("I matched the header style and date format from your **Deals — 2026 Q1** sheet").
- One invitation to revise ("Want different column widths, or the status dropdown expanded?").

Keep it to 3–5 lines. Don't list every formatting choice — the user will see the sheet.

## Conflict resolution

Explicit user instructions override convention. Ambiguous ones ("make it look nice") fall through to convention — and say so, so the user can redirect. When an override sounds durable ("every tracker should have a yellow tab from now on"), save it via `saveMemory`; one-off overrides don't need saving.

## Defaults when no reference exists

Boring baseline — safe because invisibly correct:

- `boldHeader: true`, `freezeRows: 1`, `autoResizeColumns: true`
- `freezeColumns: 1` only when col A is an identifier (name, ID, date), else `0`
- `wrapText: false` unless a description column exists
- `dataValidations` only for columns whose header implies an enum — `Status → [Active, Paused, Done]`, `Priority → [P0, P1, P2]`; ask for any other vocabulary
- Banding / tab color / borders: **skip.** Don't add ornament uninvited.

Title the file `<Topic> — <Scope>` (e.g. `Deal Pipeline — 2026 Q2`). Never `Untitled spreadsheet`.

## Destructive operations

Any `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` request in `DESTRUCTIVE_SHEETS_REQUEST_TYPES` (`deleteSheet`, `deleteRange`, `deleteDimension`, `deleteDuplicates`, `deleteEmbeddedObject`, `deleteNamedRange`, `deleteProtectedRange`, `deleteDeveloperMetadata`) needs `allowDestructive: true` and always prompts. Write a `summary` that spells out what disappears (`"Delete sheet 'Archive' (rows A1:Z500)"`, not `"Clean up"`). Prefer non-destructive alternatives — clearing a range via `updateCells` with empty values, or renaming/archiving a tab — when the user goal allows.

## Pitfalls

1. **Skipping inspection.** One `findGDriveFiles` + one read is cheap; a mismatched sheet the user re-styles by hand is expensive.
2. **Copying reference *content* instead of *style*.** The reference is for headers, formats, and vocabulary — not last quarter's data.
3. **Inventing enum values.** If Status is `["Active", "Paused", "Done"]`, do not silently widen it. Ask.
4. **Over-polishing.** A grocery list doesn't need banding, freezes, and validations. Match the ambition of the task.
5. **Using `googleSheetsBatchUpdate` for things `googleSheetsFormat` handles.** The typed path is auto-authorized; raw `batchUpdate` prompts more.
6. **Multiple `googleSheetsFormat` calls where one would batch.** One call with every option is cheaper than several.
7. **Writing values before inheriting format.** `PASTE_FORMAT` can overwrite freshly written rows' styling. Inherit structure first, then write values.
8. **Retrying on a 404 from `googleSheetsGetInfo`.** `drive.file` scope — the user hasn't picked that file. Ask for picker consent; don't loop.
9. **Forgetting the post-write brief.** Without a one-line "inherited X from Y", the sheet just looks OK, which is indistinguishable from lucky.

## Extending this skill

Other sheets skills (CRM-tracker, meeting-notes-log, weekly-metrics) should **invoke this skill first** and then layer their domain-specific headers/columns on top. The style profile is portable; the schema is not. Keep the split clean.

## Gaps to flag upstream

Two Use Brian tool lifts would materially increase this skill's confidence on visual polish. Record them in an issue, don't pretend the skill has them:

1. **`googleSheetsGetInfo` should accept `fields?: string` and `includeGridData?: boolean`.** The underlying `spreadsheets.get` already supports both; exposing them lets the skill read `userEnteredFormat`, `bandedRanges`, and `conditionalFormats` without any workaround.
2. **A `googleSheetsCopyTabTo` (or equivalent) wrapping `spreadsheets.sheets.copyTo`.** Enables cross-spreadsheet template duplication — the highest-fidelity way to seed a new file from a reference in another file.

Until those land, the skill's ceiling is: typed structural formatting + same-spreadsheet `copyPaste` inheritance. That's a high ceiling — but name the gap honestly rather than over-claiming.
